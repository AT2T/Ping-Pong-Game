Ping-Pong Game: Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is a single-player game. The game runs inside an update loop, where a function is called for every frame, updating the positions and logic of all game elements. The computer AI moves the paddle, and the ball moves in its current direction. The user can also move their paddle using the mouse. This updates all the positions and paints everything on the screen, precisely where it needs to be, within the update loop.
